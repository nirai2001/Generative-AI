      "\n",
      "To determine if a business problem is suitable for an Large Language Model (LLM) solution, consider the following factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. **Complexity**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Simple problems: LLMs excel at handling straightforward questions and provide concise answers.\n",
      "*   Medium complexity: LLMs can still struggle with moderately complex problems that require analysis or nuance.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Information Quality**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   High-quality data: LLMs need accurate, up-to-date information to generate reliable responses.\n",
      "*   Low-quality data: LLMs may produce inaccurate or misleading results if they rely on incomplete or outdated information.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Business Objectives**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Align with business goals: The problem should address a key business objective or challenge.\n",
      "*   Insufficient alignment: If the problem doesn't directly relate to business objectives, it's unlikely to be successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. **Resource Availability**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Access to relevant data and information: LLMs require sufficient data to generate accurate responses.\n",
      "*   Limited access to resources: Without adequate resources or support, LLMs may struggle to provide effective solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. **Domain Expertise**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Relevance to domain knowledge: The problem should be grounded in the relevant business domain.\n",
      "*   Lack of domain expertise: Without domain-specific knowledge, LLMs might not fully understand the context and nuances of the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. **Business Requirements**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Clear requirements: The problem statement should clearly articulate what needs to be solved or achieved.\n",
      "*   Ambiguous requirements: If the requirements are unclear or poorly defined, it may lead to ineffective solutions.\n",

      "| Summarizing news articles related to a specific industry or topic | Partly Suitable |\n",
      "\n",
      "When in doubt, consider the following questions:\n",
      "\n",
